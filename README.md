_Challenge: OOP in python with a card game_

## Description
This readme will contain how I went about the Becode-project _'Making a card game in Python wih OOP'_.

After practicing Python_basics and Python_advanced, we were given this challenge.

> You apply for a job as a developer for an online casino called WeTakeYourMoney.
> They are interested in your profile. During the interview challenge, they ask you to build a card game in Python.

So let's get started.

## Installation
Nothing had to be installed.

I already installed _Anaconda Navigator_. Through this I could use _Visual Studio Code_.

## Usage

### Get the repo ready

A repo was made.
> challenge-card-game-becode.

In it files were saved (still empty).
- README.md
- main.py

A folder was made _utils_. In it 3 files were saved (also still empty).
- card.py
- player.py
- game.py

### Working on the files

- card.py

- game.py & main.py

I haven't finished this yet.

## Personal feedback
During the challenge I felt all the feelings on the emotional spectrum. I felt challenged and wanted to find the solution (till even now).

I remarked some gaps in my knowledge in Python_advanced. So I will work further on this.

I also remarked that putting the pieces together caused a brain-freeze. So I intend to figure this out and how to have a game that can be played wholly.
